# Introduction


There are resources on building on blockchain, but there are very few tailored for advanced developers. This book is for those who want to master blockchain with  Arbitrum as the base implementation and the art of building on its platform. It delves deep into Arbitrum’s dual architecture, advanced scaling techniques, custom rollups, cross-chain intents, and state-of-the-art DeFi integrations. You'll explore sophisticated topics like Uniswap V3/V4 with custom hooks and the Uniswap SDK, account abstraction through ERC‑4337 versus EIP‑7702, and low-level optimizations using Yul, Huff, and inline assembly. In addition, the book covers cutting-edge innovations such as Arbitrum Stylus, stealth addresses, and autonomous AI agents, while also providing in-depth knowledge on node management, staking, and active contributions to the Arbitrum DAO. Whether your goal is to build a robust DeFi protocol, launch a custom ecosystem rollup, or create an advanced NFT ecosystem with token-bound accounts, this book equips you with the strategic insights and practical projects required to excel in the rapidly evolving Arbitrum ecosystem.
